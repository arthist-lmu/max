## About the Project

In recent years, large museum databases have been created, especially in the Anglo-Saxon countries, which are made available via Linked Open Data and Application Programming Interfaces and await meaningful use. In doing so, they provide a previously unknown opportunity for an extensive empirical exploration of the history of the collections. Above all, their mass data character is of interest, which is to be used in an innovative process of Distant Viewing to interpret large-scale historical processes.
