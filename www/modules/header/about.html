<div class="card"><img src="images/poster_empty.png" title="Steps"></div><p>In recent years, large museum databases have been created in the international museum sector that are awaiting meaningful use. They offer a hitherto unknown opportunity for empirical investigation of the history of collections, which can be expected to yield far-reaching results, especially in a comparative perspective. <i>Museum Analytics</i>, <i>MAX</i>, is intended to enable lecturers to import freely selectable museum databases and make them available to students for analysis.</p>

<p><i>MAX</i> was funded from 1 March to 30 November 2018 within the program <i>Lehre&shy;@LMU</i> to strengthen research orientation in teaching. It is a project of the <i>IT-Gruppe Geistes&shy;wissen&shy;schaften</i>, the Institute of Statistics and the Institute of Art History at <i>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München</i>. Our team consists of Severin Burg, B.A., Prof. Dr. Hubertus Kohle, Prof. Dr. Helmut Küchenhoff and Stefanie Schneider, M.Sc.</p>

<p>The web application is written using <i>R</i> and the <i>Shiny</i> web framework. It is open source and licensed under <i>GNU General Public License v3.0</i>. This version is a complete re-implementation that makes use of <i>Shiny</i> modules and custom HTML templates.</p>
